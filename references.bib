abstract = {The biogenic emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes are one of the main drivers of atmospheric photochemistry, including oxidant and secondary organic aerosol production. In this paper, the emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes from Australian vegetation are investigated for the first time using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGANv2.1); the CSIRO chemical transport model; and atmospheric observations of isoprene, monoterpenes and isoprene oxidation products (methacrolein and methyl vinyl ketone). Observations from four field campaigns during three different seasons are used, covering urban, coastal suburban and inland forest areas. The observed concentrations of isoprene and monoterpenes were of a broadly similar magnitude, which may indicate that southeast Australia holds an unusual position where neither chemical species dominates. The model results overestimate the observed atmospheric concentrations of isoprene (up to a factor of 6) and underestimate the monoterpene concentrations (up to a factor of 4). This may occur because the emission rates currently used in MEGANv2.1 for Australia are drawn mainly from young eucalypt trees ({\textless} 7 years), which may emit more isoprene than adult trees. There is no single increase/decrease factor for the emissions which suits all seasons and conditions studied. There is a need for further field measurements of in situ isoprene and monoterpene emission fluxes in Australia.},

abstract = {Atmospheric oxidation of isoprene emission from land plants affects radiative forcing of global climate change. There is an urgent need to understand the factors that control isoprene emission variability on large spatiotemporal scales but such direct observations of isoprene emission do not exist. Two readily available global-scale long-term observations hold information about surface isoprene activity: gross primary productivity (GPP) and tropospheric formaldehyde column variability (HCHOv). We analyze multi-year seasonal linear correlations between observed GPP and HCHOv. The observed GPP-HCHOv correlation patterns are used to evaluate a global Earth system model that embeds three alternative leaf-level isoprene emission algorithms. GPP and HCHOv are decoupled in the summertime southeast US (r = −0.03). In the Amazon, GPP-HCHOv are weakly correlated in March-April-May (MAM), correlated in June-July-August (JJA) and weakly anti-correlated in September-October-November (SON). Isoprene emission algorithms that include soil moisture dependence demonstrate greater skill in reproducing the observed interannual seasonal GPP-HCHOv correlations in the southeast US and the Amazon. In isoprene emission models that include soil moisture dependence, isoprene emission is correlated with photosynthesis and anti-correlated with HCHOv. In an isoprene emission model without soil moisture dependence, isoprene emission is anti-correlated with photosynthesis and correlated with HCHOv. Long-term monitoring of isoprene emission, soil moisture and meteorology is required in water-limited ecosystems to improve understanding of the factors controlling isoprene emission and its representation in global Earth system models.},

abstract = {An assessment of the consistency of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol products with the results from other satellite aerosol sensors is performed in this paper. The OMI aerosol products include the UltraViolet Aerosol Index (UVAI), Aerosol Absorption Optical Depth (AAOD), and Aerosol Extinction Optical Depth (AOD). The OMI AOD is compared with that from Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Terra/Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR). OMI-retrieved AOD values are generally biased high with respect to MODIS measurements, likely as a result of a calibration offset. Subpixel cloud contamination is the second most important source of error. Other sources of error may contribute to the noise in the retrieval but not necessarily to the systematic bias. In spite of the bias, OMI retrievals show a high degree of correlation with MODIS observations. The analyses of daily cloud-free collocated AOD data between OMI and MODIS show about 0.15 root mean square error on average relative to the linear fit. OMI also shows a reasonable agreement with MODIS and MISR observations in seasonal annual cycles of aerosols over most of the major emission sources of carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning and mineral dust from deserts. The AAOD is less sensitive to cloud contamination than the AOD. In addition, the information content in the UVAI is well expressed as AAOD with higher correlation than AOD. However, subpixel cloud contamination of OMI footprint (13 � 24 km2 at nadir) is unavoidable, and retrieved AOD values tend to be overestimated with varying degrees of sensitivity as a function of viewing geometry and aerosol types selected.},

abstract = {Abstract. Isoprene emissions from vegetation have a large effect on atmospheric chemistry and air quality. "Bottom-up" isoprene emission inventories used in atmospheric models are based on limited vegetation information and uncertain land cover data, leading to potentially large errors. Satellite observations of atmospheric formaldehyde (HCHO), a high-yield isoprene oxidation product, provide "top-down" information to evaluate isoprene emission inventories through inverse analyses. Past inverse analyses have however been hampered by uncertainty in the HCHO satellite data, uncertainty in the time- and NOx-dependent yield of HCHO from isoprene oxidation, and coarse resolution of the atmospheric models used for the inversion. Here we demonstrate the ability to use HCHO satellite data from OMI in a high-resolution inversion to constrain isoprene emissions on ecosystem-relevant scales. The inversion uses the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at 0.25 x 0.3125 horizontal resolution to interpret observations over the southeast US in August-September 2013. It takes advantage of concurrent NASA SEAC4RS aircraft observations of isoprene and its oxidation products including HCHO to validate the OMI HCHO data over the region, test the GEOS-Chem isoprene oxidation mechanism and NOx environment, and independently evaluate the inversion. This evaluation shows in particular that local model errors in NOx concentrations propagate to biases in inferring isoprene emissions from HCHO data. It is thus essential to correct model NOx biases, which was done here using SEAC4RS observations but can be done more generally using satellite NO2 data concurrently with HCHO. We find in our inversion that isoprene emissions from the widely used MEGAN v2.1 inventory are biased high over the southeast US by 40{\%} on average, although the broad-scale distributions are correct including maximum emissions in Arkansas/Louisiana and high base emission factors in the oak-covered Ozarks of southeast Missouri. A particularly large discrepancy is in the Edwards Plateau of central Texas where MEGAN v2.1 is too high by a factor of 3, possibly reflecting errors in land cover. The lower isoprene emissions inferred from our inversion, when implemented into GEOS-Chem, decrease surface ozone over the southeast US by 1-3ppb and decrease the isoprene contribution to organic aerosol from 40 to 20{\%}.},

abstract = {Eucalypts are among the highest emitters of biogenic volatile organic compounds, yet there is relatively little data available from field studies of this genus. Emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes and the short-chained carbonyls formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone were determined from four species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus grandis, and Eucalytpus viminalis) in Australia. A smaller comparative study was conducted on E. camaldulensis in south-eastern Australia. Carbonyl emissions, reported here for the first time from eucalypts, were generally comparable with rates reported for other species, with diurnal emissions peaking at about 4, 75 and 34??nmol??m-2??min-1 for acetone, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde respectively. There was wide variation in diurnal isoprene and monoterpene emissions between species, but under standard conditions, isoprene emissions were much lower than previous reports. Conversely, standard emission rates of monoterpenes were as much as six times greater than previous reports for some species. Emission of each carbonyl was correlated with its ambient concentration across different species, but more weakly related to temperature. Acetaldehyde emission in particular was significantly correlated with transpiration, but not with sap flow or with ethanol concentrations in xylem sap, suggesting fermentation within the leaf and stomatal conductance are primary controlling processes. Differences in acetaldehyde exchange velocities between sites, in addition to transpiration differences, suggest stomata may indeed exert long term emission regulation, in contrast to compounds for which no biological sink exists. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Isoprene photooxidation is a major driver of atmospheric chemistry over forested regions. Isoprene reacts with hydroxyl radicals (OH) and molecular oxygen to produce isoprene peroxy radicals (ISOPOO). These radicals can react with hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2) to dominantly produce hydroxyhydroperoxides (ISOPOOH). They can also react with nitric oxide (NO) to largely produce methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR). Unimolecular isomerization and bimolecular reactions with organic peroxy radicals are also possible. There is uncertainty about the relative importance of each of these pathways in the atmosphere and possible changes because of anthropogenic pollution. Herein, measurements of ISOPOOH and MVK + MACR concentrations are reported over the central region of the Amazon basin during the wet season. The research site, downwind of an urban region, intercepted both background and polluted air masses during the GoAmazon2014/5 Experiment. Under background conditions, the confidence interval for the ratio of the ISOPOOH concentration to that of MVK + MACR spanned 0.4–0.6. This result implies a ratio of the reaction rate of ISOPOO with HO2 to that with NO of approximately unity. A value of unity is significantly smaller than simulated at present by global chemical transport models for this important, nominally low-NO, forested region of Earth. Under polluted conditions, when the concentrations of reactive nitrogen compounds were high ({\textgreater}1 ppb), ISOPOOH concentrations dropped below the instrumental detection limit ({\textless}60 ppt). This abrupt shift in isoprene photooxidation, sparked by human activities, speaks to ongoing and possible future changes in the photochemistry active over the Amazon rainforest.},

abstract = {Formaldehyde (HCHO) being a high-yield product in the oxidation of most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by fires, vegetation and anthropogenic activities, satellite observations of HCHO are well-suited to inform us on the spatial and temporal variability of the underlying VOC sources. The long-record of space-based HCHO column observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is used to infer emission flux estimates from pyrogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the global scale over 2005–2013. This is realized through the method of source inverse modelling, which consists in the optimization of emissions in a chemistry-transport model (CTM) in order to minimize the discrepancy between the observed and modelled HCHO columns. The top-down fluxes are derived in the global CTM IMAGESv2 by an iterative minimization algorithm based on the full adjoint of IMAGESv2, starting from a priori emission estimates provided by the newly released GFED4s (Global Fire Emission Database, version 4s) inventory for fires, and by the MEGAN-MOHYCAN inventory for isoprene emissions. The top-down fluxes are compared to two independent inventories for fire (GFAS and FINNv1.5) and isoprene emissions (MEGAN-MACC and GUESS-ES). The inversion indicates a moderate decrease (ca. 20 {\%}) of the average annual global fire and isoprene emissions, from 2028 TgC in the a priori to 1653 TgC for burnt biomass, and from 343 to 272 Tg for isoprene fluxes. Those estimates are acknowledged to depend on the accuracy of formaldehyde data, as well as on the assumed fire emission factors and the oxidation mechanisms leading to HCHO production. Strongly decreased top-down fire fluxes (30–50 {\%}) are inferred in the peak fire season in Africa, and during years with strong a priori fluxes associated to forest fires in Amazonia (in 2005, 2007 and 2010), bushfires in Australia (in 2006 and 2011), and peat burning in Indonesia (in 2006 and 2009), whereas generally increased fluxes are suggested in Indochina and during the 2007 fires in Southern Europe. Moreover, changes in fire seasonal patterns are suggested, e.g. the seasonal amplitude is reduced over Southeast Asia. In Africa, the inversion indicates increased fluxes due to agricultural fires, and decreased maxima when natural fires are dominant. The top-down fire emissions are much better correlated with MODIS fire counts than the a priori inventory in regions with small and agricultural fires, indicating that the OMI-based inversion is well-suited to assess the associated emissions. Regarding biogenic sources, significant reductions of isoprene fluxes are inferred in tropical ecosystems (30–40 {\%}), suggesting overestimated basal emission rates in those areas in the bottom-up inventory, whereas strongly positive isoprene emission updates are derived over semi-arid and desert areas, especially in Southern Africa and Australia. This finding suggests that the parameterization of the soil moisture stress used in MEGAN greatly exaggerates the flux reduction due to drought in those regions. The isoprene emission trends over 2005–2013 are often enhanced after optimization, with positive top-down trends in Siberia (4.2 {\%}/yr) and Eastern Europe (3.9 {\%}/yr), likely reflecting forest expansion and warming temperatures, and negative trends in Amazonia (−2.1 {\%}/yr), South China (−1 {\%}/yr), the United States (−3.7 {\%}/yr), and Western Europe (−3.3 {\%}/yr), which are generally corroborated by independent studies, yet their interpretation warrants further investigation.},

The model estimated mean annual total BVOC emission of 760 Tg (C) yr(-1) consisting of isoprene (70 {\%}), monoterpenes (11 {\%}), methanol (6 {\%}), acetone (3 {\%}), sesquiterpenes (2.5 {\%}) and other BVOC species each contributing less than 2 {\%}. Several sensitivity model runs were performed to study the impact of different model input and model settings on isoprene estimates and resulted in differences of up to +/-17{\%} of the reference isoprene total. A greater impact was observed for a sensitivity run applying parameterization of soil moisture deficit that led to a 50{\%} reduction of isoprene emissions on a global scale, most significantly in specific regions of Africa, South America and Australia. MEGAN-MACC estimates are comparable to results of previous studies. More detailed comparison with other isoprene inventories indicated significant spatial and temporal differences between the data sets especially for Australia, Southeast Asia and South America. MEGAN-MACC estimates of isoprene, alpha-pinene and group of monoterpenes showed a reasonable agreement with surface flux measurements at sites located in tropical forests in the Amazon and Malaysia. The model was able to capture the seasonal variation of isoprene emissions in the Amazon forest.},

abstract = {Quantifying isoprene emissions using satellite observations of the formaldehyde (HCHO) columns is subject to errors involving the column retrieval and the assumed relationship between HCHO columns and isoprene emissions, taken here from the GEOS-CHEM chemical transport model. Here we use a 6-year (1996–2001) HCHO column data set from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite instrument to (1) quantify these errors, (2) evaluate GOME-derived isoprene emissions with in situ flux measurements and a process-based emission inventory (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature, MEGAN), and (3) investigate the factors driving the seasonal and interannual variability of North American isoprene emissions. The error in the GOME HCHO column retrieval is estimated to be 40{\%}. We use the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) to quantify the time-dependent HCHO production from isoprene, $\alpha$- and $\beta$-pinenes, and methylbutenol and show that only emissions of isoprene are detectable by GOME. The time-dependent HCHO yield from isoprene oxidation calculated by MCM is 20–30{\%} larger than in GEOS-CHEM. GOME-derived isoprene fluxes track the observed seasonal variation of in situ measurements at a Michigan forest site with a −30{\%} bias. The seasonal variation of North American isoprene emissions during 2001 inferred from GOME is similar to MEGAN, with GOME emissions typically 25{\%} higher (lower) at the beginning (end) of the growing season. GOME and MEGAN both show a maximum over the southeastern United States, but they differ in the precise location. The observed interannual variability of this maximum is 20–30{\%}, depending on month. The MEGAN isoprene emission dependence on surface air temperature explains 75{\%} of the month-to-month variability in GOME-derived isoprene emissions over the southeastern United States during May–September 1996–2001.},

abstract = {Emission of non-methane Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to the atmosphere stems from biogenic and human activities, and their estimation is difficult because of the many and not fully understood processes involved. In order to narrow down the uncertainty related to VOC emissions, which negatively reflects on our ability to simulate the atmospheric composition, we exploit satellite observations of formaldehyde (HCHO), an ubiquitous oxidation product of most VOCs, focusing on Europe. HCHO column observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) reveal a marked seasonal cycle with a summer maximum and winter minimum. In summer, the oxidation of methane and other long-lived VOCs supply a slowly varying background HCHO column, while HCHO variability is dominated by most reactive VOC, primarily biogenic isoprene followed in importance by biogenic terpenes and anthropogenic VOCs. The chemistry-transport model CHIMERE qualitatively reproduces the temporal and spatial features of the observed HCHO column, but display regional biases which are attributed mainly to incorrect biogenic VOC emissions, calculated with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosol from Nature (MEGAN) algorithm. These "bottom-up" or a-priori emissions are corrected through a Bayesian inversion of the OMI HCHO observations. Resulting "top-down" or a-posteriori isoprene emissions are lower than "bottom-up" by 40{\%} over the Balkans and by 20{\%} over Southern Germany, and higher by 20{\%} over Iberian Peninsula, Greece and Italy. We conclude that OMI satellite observations of HCHO can provide a quantitative "top-down" constraint on the European "bottom-up" VOC inventories.},

abstract = {A new version of the BVOC emission scheme has been developed in the global vegetation model ORCHIDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEm), including an extended list of biogenic emitted compounds, updated emission factors (EFs), a dependency on light for almost all compounds and a multi-layer radiation scheme. For the 2000–2009 period, we estimate with this model, mean global emissions of 465 Tg C yr-1 for isoprene, 107.5 Tg C yr-1 for monoterpenes, 38 Tg C yr-1 for methanol, 25 Tg C yr-1 for acetone and 24 Tg C yr-1 for sesquiterpenes. The model results are compared to state-of-the-art emission budgets, showing that the ORCHIDEE emissions are within the range of published estimates. ORCHIDEE BVOC emissions are compared to the estimates of the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN), largely used throughout the biogenic emissions and atmospheric chemistry community. Our results show that global emission budgets are, in general, in good agreement between the two models. ORCHIDEE emissions are 8 {\%} higher for isoprene, 8 {\%} lower for methanol, 17 {\%} higher for acetone, 18 {\%} higher for monoterpenes and 39 {\%} higher for sesquiterpenes compared to MEGAN estimates. At the regional scale, the largest differences between ORCHIDEE and MEGAN are highlighted for isoprene in northern temperate regions, with the ORCHIDEE emissions being higher by 21 Tg C yr-1, and for monoterpenes being higher by 10 and 18 Tg C yr-1 in northern and southern tropical regions compared to MEGAN. The geographical differences, between the two models, are mainly associated with different EF and PFT distribution, while differences in the seasonal cycle are mostly driven by differences in the Leaf Area Index (LAI). Sensitivity tests are carried out for both models to explore the response to key variables or parameters such as LAI and Light Dependent Fraction (LDF). The ORCHIDEE and MEGAN emissions are differently affected by LAI changes, with a response highly sensitive to the considered compound. When the LAI is scaled by a factor of 0.5 (1.5), the global emission change is −21 {\%} (+8 {\%}) for ORCHIDEE and −15 {\%} (+7 {\%}) for MEGAN regarding isoprene, and is −43 {\%} (+40 {\%}) for ORCHIDEE and −11 {\%} (+3 {\%}) for MEGAN regarding monoterpenes. We find that MEGAN is more sensitive to variation of LDF parameter than ORCHIDEE. Our results highlight the importance and the need to further explore the BVOC emission estimate variability and the interest of using models to investigate the estimate uncertainties.},

abstract = {Isoprene is the predominant non-methane volatile organic compound emitted to the atmosphere and shapes tropospheric composition and biogeochemistry through its effects on ozone, other oxidants, aerosols, and the nitrogen cycle. Isoprene is emitted naturally by vegetation during daytime, when its photo-oxidation is rapid and in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx) produces ozone and degrades air quality in polluted regions. Here we show for a city downwind of an isoprene-emitting forest (St. Louis, USA) that isoprene actually peaks at night; ambient levels then endure owing to low nighttime OH radical concentrations. Nocturnal chemistry controls the fate of that isoprene and the likelihood of a high-ozone episode the following day. When nitrate (NO3) radicals are suppressed, high isoprene persists through the night, providing photochemical fuel upon daybreak and leading to a dramatic late-morning ozone peak. On nights with significant NO3, isoprene is removed before dawn; days with low morning isoprene then have lower ozone with a more typical afternoon peak. This biogenic-anthropogenic coupling expands the daily high-ozone window and likely has opposite O3-NOx response to what would otherwise be expected, with implications for exposure and air quality management in cities that, like St. Louis, are downwind of major isoprene-emitting forests.},

abstract = {The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGAN2.1) is a modeling framework for estimating fluxes of biogenic compounds between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere using simple mechanistic algorithms to account for the major known processes controlling biogenic emissions. It is available as an offline code and has also been coupled into land surface and atmospheric chemistry models. MEGAN2.1 is an update from the previous versions including MEGAN2.0, which was described for isoprene emissions by Guenther et al. (2006) and MEGAN2.02, which was described for monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions by Sakulyanontvittaya et al. (2008). Isoprene comprises about half of the total global biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emission of 1 Pg (1000 Tg or 1015 g) estimated using MEGAN2.1. Methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, t-beta-ocimene, limonene, ethene, and propene together contribute another 30{\%} of the MEGAN2.1 estimated emission. An additional 20 compounds (mostly terpenoids) are associated with the MEGAN2.1 estimates of another 17{\%} of the total emission with the remaining 3{\%} distributed among {\textgreater}100 compounds. Emissions of 41 monoterpenes and 32 sesquiterpenes together comprise about 15{\%} and 3 {\%}, respectively, of the estimated total global BVOC emission. Tropical trees cover about 18{\%} of the global land surface and are estimated to be responsible for similar to 80{\%} of terpenoid emissions and similar to 50{\%} of other VOC emissions. Other trees cover about the same area but are estimated to contribute only about 10{\%} of total emissions. The magnitude of the emissions estimated with MEGAN2.1 are within the range of estimates reported using other approaches and much of the differences between reported values can be attributed to land cover and meteorological driving variables. The offline version of MEGAN2.1 source code and driving variables is available from http://bai.acd.ucar.edu/MEGAN/ and the version integrated into the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) can be downloaded from http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/.},

abstract = {We interpret HCHO column variations observed by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), aboard the NASA Aura satellite, over India during 2014 using the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry and transport model. We use a nested version of the model with a spatial resolution of approximately 25km. HCHO columns are related to local emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with a spatial smearing that increases with the VOC lifetime. Over India, HCHO has biogenic, pyrogenic, and anthropogenic VOC sources. Using a 0-D photochemistry model, we find that isoprene has the largest molar yield of HCHO that is typically realized within a few hours. We find that forested regions that neighbours major urban conurbations are exposed to high levels of nitrogen oxides. This results in depleted hydroxyl radical concentrations and a delay in the production of HCHO from isoprene oxidation. We find that propene is the only anthropogenic VOC emitted in major Indian cities that produces HCHO at a comparable (slower) rate to isoprene. The GEOS-Chem model reproduces the broadscale annual mean HCHO column distribution observed by OMI (r=0.6), which is dominated by a distinctive meridional gradient in the northern half of the country, and by localized regions of high columns that coincide with forests. Major discrepancies are over the Indo-Gangetic Plain and Delhi. We find that the model has more skill at reproducing observations during winter (JF) and pre-monsoon (MAM) months with Pearson correlations r{\textgreater}0.5 but with a positive model bias of 1e15 molec/cm2. During the monsoon season (JJAS) we reproduce only a diffuse version of the observed meridional gradient (r=0.4). Generally, we find that on a continental scale most of the seasonal cycle is explained by monthly variations in surface temperature (r=0.9), suggesting a strong role for biogenic VOCs, in agreement with the 0-D and GEOS-Chem model calculations. We also find that the seasonal cycle during 2014 is not significantly different from the 2008-2015 mean seasonal variation but there are large year to year variations. There are two main loci for biomass burning (states of Punjab and Haryana, and northeastern India), which we find only contributes a significant contribution (up to 1e15 molec/cm2) to observed HCHO columns during March to April over northeastern India. The slow production of HCHO from propene oxidation results in a smeared hotspot over Delhi that we resolve only on an annual mean timescale by using a temporal oversampling method. Using a linear regression model to relate GEOS-Chem isoprene emissions to HCHO columns we infer seasonal isoprene emissions over two key forest regions from the OMI HCHO column data. We find that the a posteriori emissions are typically lower than the a priori emissions, with a much stronger reduction of emissions during the monsoon season. We find that this reduction in emissions during monsoon months coincides with a large drop in satellite observations of leaf phenology that recovers in post monsoon months. This may signal a forest-scale response to monsoon conditions.},

abstract = {Due to the scarcity of observational constraints and the rapidly changing environment in East and Southeast Asia, isoprene emissions predicted by models are expected to bear substantial uncertainties. The aim of this study is to improve upon the existing bottom-up estimates, and to investigate the temporal evolution of the fluxes in Asia over 1979-2012. To this purpose, we calculate the hourly emissions at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution using the MEGAN-MOHYCAN model driven by ECMWF ERA-Interim climatology. In order to remedy for known biases identified in previous studies, and to improve the simulation of interannual variability and trends in emissions, this study incorporates (i) changes in land use, including the rapid expansion of oil palms, (ii) meteorological variability according to ERA-Interim, (iii) long-term changes in solar radiation (dimming/brightening) constrained by surface network radiation measurements, and (iv) recent experimental evidence that South Asian tropical forests are much weaker isoprene emitters than previously assumed, and on the other hand, that oil palms have a strong isoprene emission capacity. These effects lead to a significant lowering (factor of 2) in the total isoprene fluxes over the studied domain, and to emission reductions reaching a factor of 3.5 in Southeast Asia. The bottom-up annual isoprene emissions for 2005 are estimated at 7.0, 4.8, 8.3, and 2.9 Tg in China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, respectively. The isoprene flux anomaly over the whole domain and studied period is found to be strongly correlated with the Oceanic Nino Index (r = 0.73), with positive (negative) anomalies related to El Nino (La Nina) years. Changes in temperature and solar radiation are the major drivers of the interannual variability and trends in the emissions, except over semi-arid areas such as northwestern China, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, where soil moisture is by far the main cause of interannual emission changes. In our base simulation, annual positive flux trends of 0.2{\%} and 0.52{\%} throughout the entire period are found in Asia and China, respectively, related to a positive trend in temperature and solar radiation. The impact of oil palm expansion in Indonesia and Malaysia is to enhance the trends over that region, e. g., from 1.17{\%} to 1.5{\%} in 1979-2005 in Malaysia. A negative emission trend is derived in India (-0.4 {\%}), owing to the negative trend in solar radiation data associated with the strong dimming effect likely due to increasing aerosol loadings. The bottom-up emissions are compared to field campaign measurements in Borneo and South China and further evaluated against top-down isoprene emission estimates constrained by GOME-2/MetOp-A formaldehyde columns through 2007-2012. The satellite-based estimates appear to support our assumptions, and confirm the lower emission rate in tropical forests of Indonesia and Malaysia. Additional flux measurements are clearly needed to characterize the spatial variability of emission factors better. Finally, a decreasing trend in the inferred top-down Chinese emissions since 2007},

abstract = {We examine the relative contribution of processes controlling the interannual variability (IAV) of tropospheric ozone over four sub-regions of the southern hemispheric tro-pospheric ozone maximum (SHTOM) over a 20-year period. Our study is based on hindcast simulations from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Global Modeling Ini-tiative chemistry transport model (NASA GMI-CTM) of tro-pospheric and stratospheric chemistry, driven by assimilated Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Appli-cations (MERRA) meteorological fields. Our analysis shows that over SHTOM region, the IAV of the stratospheric con-tribution is the most important factor driving the IAV of up-per tropospheric ozone (270 hPa), where ozone has a strong radiative effect. Over the South Atlantic region, the contri-bution from surface emissions to the IAV of ozone exceeds that from stratospheric input at and below 430 hPa. Over the South Indian Ocean, the IAV of stratospheric ozone makes the largest contribution to the IAV of ozone with little or no influence from surface emissions at 270 and 430 hPa in aus-tral winter. Over the tropical South Atlantic region, the con-tribution from IAV of stratospheric input dominates in austral winter at 270 hPa and drops to less than half but is still signif-icant at 430 hPa. Emission contributions are not significant at these two levels. The IAV of lightning over this region also contributes to the IAV of ozone in September and December. Over the tropical southeastern Pacific, the contribution of the IAV of stratospheric input is significant at 270 and 430 hPa in austral winter, and emissions have little influence.},

Improving global and regional estimates of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOCs) emissions is of great interest for their biological and environmental effects and possible positive and negative feedbacks related to climate change and other vectors of global change. Multiple studies indicate that BVOCs are on the rise, and with near 20 years of global remote sensing of formaldehyde (HCHO), the immediate and dominant BVOC atmospheric oxidation product, the accurate and quantitative linkage of BVOCs with plant ecology, atmospheric chemistry, and climate change is of increasing relevance.

abstract = {Environmental Context. Many plant species biosynthesize and emit the volatile hydrocarbon isoprene. Once in the atmosphere, isoprene is susceptible to a range of reactions involving potentially hundred of products and intermediate compounds. The products of these reactions in turn may pose a risk to human and plant health and impact the climate through the generation of acids, ozone, and atmospheric aerosols. Abstract. The atmospheric oxidation mechanism of isoprene initiated by OH, O3, NO3, and Cl, which incorporates the most recent laboratory and theoretical studies, is described. A box model intercomparison between the new mechanism and previous available isoprene oxidation mechanisms has been performed. Ozone and OH concentrations are compared with predictions by the previous mechanisms in high and low NOx scenarios. The O3 and OH sensitivities to the chlorine-isoprene reactions have also been investigated by comparing the box model results with and without the chlorine-isoprene reactions, showing that the ozone production rate and OH concentrations are slightly impacted. The new mechanism facilitates more accurate modelling of isoprene photochemistry in the atmosphere.},

abstract = {We use formaldehyde (HCHO) vertical column measurements from the Scanning Imaging Absorption spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and a nested-grid version of the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model, to infer an ensemble of top-down isoprene emission estimates from tropical South America during 2006, using different model configurations and assumptions in the HCHO air-mass factor (AMF) calculation. Scenes affected by biomass burning are removed on a daily basis using fire count observations, and we use the local model sensitivity to identify locations where the impact of spatial smearing is small, though this comprises spatial coverage over the region. We find that the use of the HCHO column data more tightly constrains the ensemble isoprene emission range from 27-61TgC to 31-38TgC for SCIAMACHY, and 45-104TgC to 28-38TgC for OMI. Median uncertainties of the top-down emissions are about 60-260{\%} for SCIAMACHY, and 10-90{\%} for OMI. We find that the inferred emissions are most sensitive to uncertainties in cloud fraction and cloud top pressure (differences of +/- 10{\%}), the a priori isoprene emissions (+/- 20{\%}), and the HCHO vertical column retrieval (+/- 30{\%}). Construction of continuous top-down emission maps generally improves GEOS-Chem's simulation of HCHO columns over the region, with respect to both the SCIAMACHY and OMI data. However, if local time top-down emissions are scaled to monthly mean values, the annual emission inferred from SCIAMACHY are nearly twice those from OMI. This difference cannot be explained by the different sampling of the sensors or uncertainties in the AMF calculation.},

The principal contributor to these emissions during the growing season is the biogenic hydrocarbon isoprene, which is of great importance for driving regional and global tropospheric chemistry. We present seven years (1995 - 2001) of HCHO column data for North America from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), and show that the general seasonal and interannual variability of these data is consistent with knowledge of isoprene emission. There are some significant regional discrepancies with the seasonal patterns predicted from current isoprene emission models, and we suggest that these may reflect flaws in the models. The interannual variability of HCHO columns observed by GOME appears to follow the interannual variability of surface temperature, as expected from current isoprene emission models.},

Previous work has proposed that the ratio of CHOCHO to HCHO ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) can be used as an indicator of precursor VOC speciation, and absolute concentrations of the CHOCHO and HCHO as indicators of NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}x{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. Because this metric is measurable by satellite, it is potentially useful on a global scale; however, absolute values and trends in {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} have differed between satellite and ground-based observations. To investigate potential causes of previous discrepancies and the usefulness of this ratio, we present measurements of CHOCHO and HCHO over the southeastern United States (SE US) from the 2013 SENEX (Southeast Nexus) flight campaign, and compare these measurements with OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite retrievals. High time-resolution flight measurements show that high {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is associated with monoterpene emissions, low {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is associated with isoprene oxidation, and emissions associated with oil and gas production can lead to small-scale variation in regional {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. During the summertime in the SE US, {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is not a reliable diagnostic of anthropogenic VOC emissions, as HCHO and CHOCHO production are dominated by isoprene oxidation. Our results show that the new CHOCHO retrieval algorithm reduces the previous disagreement between satellite and in situ {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} observations. As the absolute values and trends in {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} observed during SENEX are largely reproduced by OMI observations, we conclude that satellite-based observations of {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} can be used alongside knowledge of land use as a global diagnostic of dominant hydrocarbon speciation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In this work we identified and theoretically quantified two photolysis mechanisms of HPALDs (hydroperoxy aldehydes) that result from the isomerization of peroxy radicals in the atmospheric oxidation of isoprene at low/moderate NO x . As a first photolysis mechanism, we show that a fraction of the initially excited S 1 -state HPALDs isomerizes by a near-barrierless 1,5 H-shift at a rate approaching 10 12 s {\`{A}}1 – competing with the Bequally fast intersystem crossing to the T 2 triplet state – forming an unstable biradical that spontaneously expels an OH (hydroxyl) radical. A second mechanism is shown to proceed through the activated T 2 triplet biradical – formed from S 1 – undergoing a concerted ring-closure and OH-expulsion, yielding an oxiranyl-type co-product radical that quickly ring-opens to enoxy radicals. In both mechanisms, subsequent chemistry of the co-product radicals yields additional first-generation OH. The combined HPALD-photolysis quantum yield by these two mechanisms – which may not be the only photolysis routes – is estimated at 0.55 and the quantum yield of OH generation at 0.9, in fair accordance with experimental data on an HPALD proxy (Wolfe et al., Phys.

abstract = {The C5-hydroperoxyenals (C5-HPALDs) are a newly-recognized class of multi-functional hydrocarbons produced during the hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of isoprene. Recent theoretical calculations suggest that fast photolysis of these compounds may be an important OH source in high-isoprene, low-NO regions. We report experimental constraints for key parameters of photolysis, OH reaction and ozone reaction of these compounds as derived from a closely-related, custom-synthesized C6-HPALD. The photolysis quantum yield is 1.0 +/- 0.4 over the range 300-400 nm, assuming an absorption cross section equal to the average of those measured for several analogous enals. The yield of OH from photolysis was determined as 1.0 +/- 0.8. The OH reaction rate constant is (5.1 +/- 1.8) [times] 10-11 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 at 296 K. The ozone reaction rate constant is (1.2 +/- 0.2) [times] 10-18 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 at 296 K. These results are consistent with previous first-principles estimates, though the nature and fate of secondary oxidation products remains uncertain. Incorporation of C5-HPALD chemistry with the above parameters in a 0-D box model, along with experimentally-constrained rates for C5-HPALD production from isomerization of first-generation isoprene hydroxyperoxy radicals, is found to enhance modeled OH concentrations by 5-16{\%} relative to the traditional isoprene oxidation mechanism for the chemical regimes of recent observational studies in rural and remote regions. This enhancement in OH will increase if C5-HPALD photo-oxidation products also photolyze to yield additional OH or if the C5-HPALD production rate is faster than has been observed.},

The CO and HCHO are respectively from the MOPITT and OMI instruments. The multi-species and multi-satellite dataset inversion is done for the 2005–2010 period. The robustness of our results is evaluated by comparing our posterior-modeled concentrations with several sets of independent measurements of atmospheric mixing ratios. The inversion leads to significant changes from the prior to the posterior, in terms of magnitude and seasonality of the CO and CH4 surface fluxes and of the HCHO production by non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). The latter is significantly decreased, indicating an overestimation of the biogenic NMVOC emissions, such as isoprene, in the GEIA inventory. CO and CH4 surface emissions are increased by the inversion, from 1037 to 1394 TgCO and from 489 to 529 TgCH4 on average for the 2005–2010 period. CH4 emissions present significant interannual variability and a joint CO-CH4 fluxes analysis reveals that tropical biomass burning probably played a role in the recent increase of atmospheric methane.},
